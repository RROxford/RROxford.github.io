We ran a short "taster" session on reproducible research in the
humanities at the annual
[Digital Humanities Oxford Summer School](http://www.dhoxss.net). This
was part of the *Introduction to Digitial Humanities* strand. It took
place on July 5, 2017, with around 40 attendees.

The material covered a brief overview of git with some python,
developed from relevant Software and Data Carpentry material. The
material forms the basis for the planned
[September workshop](/2017-08-08-workshop-announcement/).
