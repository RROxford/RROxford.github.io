We are pleased to announce that we will be running a "taster" session
on reproducible research in the humanities at the annual
[Digital Humanities Oxford Summer School](http://www.dhoxss.net). The
session will be part of the *Introduction to Digitial Humanities
strand*, and it will take place on July 5, 2017.

The material will cover git with some python, developed from relevant
Software and Data Carpentry material.
