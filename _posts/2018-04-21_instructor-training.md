We are now taking expressions of interest for this year's <a
href="https://carpentries.org/teach/" target="_blank">instructor
training</a> at Oxford. Attendance of this two-day <a
href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/"
target="_blank">event</a>, followed by a simple <a
href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/"
target="_blank">check-out process</a>, allows participants to qualify
as instructors for <a href="https://carpentries.org/"
target="_blank">the Carpentries</a>.

The training will be held on May 24--25, 2018 at the <a
href="http://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">School of
Anthropology and Museum Ethnography</a>.

**Note:** the workshop times are 8:00--16:00, and participation for
  the whole duration is required on both days.

As part of our partnership with <a href="https://carpentries.org/"
target="_blank">the Carpentries</a>, the training is provided free of
charge to members of the University. Places are limited and will be
allocated to take into account a number of considerations, in line
with our goal to build a sustainable community of instructors based in
Oxford.

Expressions of interest are welcome from all members of the University
--- students, researchers, and staff in any unit! See the links below
for information on the curriculum and the check-out process, then
contact <a href="../laura-fortunato">Laura Fortunato</a> at <a
href="mailto:ReproducibleResearchOxford@gmail.com">ReproducibleResearchOxford@gmail.com</a>

information.
