We will be holding our next <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/"
target="_blank">Data Carpentry</a> workshop on September 26--27, 2017
in the <a href="www.icea.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Institute of
Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology</a>. The The <a
href="https://rroxford.github.io/2017-09-26-oxford/"
target="_blank">workshop</a> will cover spreadsheets, OpenRefine, SQL,
and python, with a focus on humanities data.

This workshop builds on the successful "taster" <a
href="./2017-07-10-dhoxss-session.md">session</a> led by <a
href="../../iain-emsley">Iain Emsley</a> at the 2017
[Digital Humanities Oxford Summer School](http://www.dhoxss.net). It
is part of our efforts to develop a pilot Data Carpentry curriculum
for the digital humanities, which we will be contributing back to the
community.

The workshop is free and open to students, researchers, and staff of
the University --- see the workshop website for details, including
information on how to register.
