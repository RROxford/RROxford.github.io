It's time for more Reproducibility Events at Oxford this term!
There will be two weekly events relating to reproducibility and open
research, on Wednesday afternoon and Friday lunch time.

Back after a successful run in Trinity Term 2018 is the <a

Experimental Psychology</a>. This term they'll be meeting Fridays
13:00--14:00 in the Milner Room, New Radcliffe House. Come along for
discussion, snacks, and open science!
