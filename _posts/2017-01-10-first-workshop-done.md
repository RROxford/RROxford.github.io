We ran our first successful Software Carpentry workshop on January
9--10, 2017 at [TORCH | The Oxford Research Centre in the
Humanities](http://torch.ox.ac.uk/). The
[workshop](https://rroxford.github.io/2017-01-09-oxford/) covered
bash, git, and python, with sessions led by instructors <a
href="../../phil-fowler">Phil Fowler</a> and <a
href="../../iain-emsley">Iain-Emsley</a>. We had ~25 participants
drawn from across the University, making for a fun and diverse
learning experience!
