Reproducible Research Oxford is a project based at the University of Oxford. The project aims to lay the groundwork for a culture of research reproducibility at Oxford, focusing on training in the effective use of computational tools in research. These tools are widely used in some disciplines, and they can enable researchers to easily track the process leading from data to results, so that it is fully reproducible. However, researchers often lack the opportunities, incentives and confidence to make best use of these tools.

As part of the project, we have set up a partnership between the University of Oxford and [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) Carpentry, non-profit volunteer organisations focused on teaching researchers across disciplines the computing and data skills they need for effective and reproducible research. We will coordinate and deliver a series of Software/Data Carpentry workshops open to students and staff across the University. Additionally, we will train Software/Data Carpentry instructors based at Oxford to build local capacity in this area.

The project is supported by the [IT Innovation Challenges Fund](http://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/innovation-challenges/researchreproducibility/) and the [Social Sciences Division](https://www.socsci.ox.ac.uk/), with grants to [Laura Fortunato](www.santafe.edu/~fortunato/). It is based in the [School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography](http://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Oxford e-Research Centre]www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/), with members drawn from across the [University](http://rroxford.github.io/meet-the-team).

Are you interested in running a Software/Data Carpenty workshop for your research group, department, or other unit? Then we may be able to help! Do [get in touch](http://rroxford.github.io/contact) to discuss.
