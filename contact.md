Are you passionate about reproducibility and open research? There are several ways to get involved, from attending a workshop to joining the [project team](http://rroxford.github.io/meet-the-team)! We are also looking for volunteers to help out with the workshops, as a host, helper, and/or instructor.

For announcements about future workshops and related activities, check our website, subscribe to our [mailing list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/info/rroxford) and follow us on Twitter [@RR_Oxford](https://twitter.com/RR_Oxford).
