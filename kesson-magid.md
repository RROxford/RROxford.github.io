Kesson is a biological anthropologist. His research interests include
ecological and cultural influences upon human health, in particular
the evolution of early life influences on adult cognitive,
reproductive, and immune traits.

He is a lecturer at the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary
Anthropology and in Medical Anthropology at the School of Anthropology
and Museum Ethnography at the University of Oxford and an honorary
research fellow at Durham University Department of Anthropology.

Kesson helped organise the first Reproducible Research Oxford/Software
Carpentry workshop in January 2017. Prior to that he had worked
primarily in R, but has been picking up git and unix shell.
